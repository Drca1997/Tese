Diogo Alves' Master Dissertation: **Modeling Synthetic Players as an Instrument for Testing Generative Content**

Master thesis focused on AI in Games, more precisely on modeling AI 
characters to playtest procedurally generated game scenarios. Two approaches 
were used: a classical one consisted in action planning, and a machine learning one, 
using the Unity ML-Agents framework to implement state-of-art RL algorithms.
